Safety and security come first: We prioritize your safety. Each downloader was scanned using reputable antivirus software to guarantee they were free of malware or other harmful programs. Additionally, we checked for intrusive advertising or unwanted bundled software during installation or use.

Core download functionality: We put each downloader to the test with a diverse range of YouTube videos. We varied factors like resolution (SD, HD, 4K, 8K), format (MP4, WebM, etc.), and popularity to identify any limitations or inconsistencies in download success rates. Download speed was another crucial aspect. We measured how quickly each app could grab videos, especially important for large files or multiple downloads.

Flexibility and control: We assessed the downloaders' ability to cater to your preferences. This included the range of output formats offered, allowing you to choose one compatible with your device or desired video quality. We also evaluated the available resolution options, ensuring you can pick between low (smaller file size) and high definition (for best quality). Additionally, we tested the capability for batch downloading playlists or multiple videos at once, saving you valuable time and effort.

User experience matters: A smooth and intuitive experience is vital. We evaluated the user interface (UI) of each downloader, assessing its ease of navigation. A user-friendly design is especially important for beginners. We also looked at the installation process, ensuring it's straightforward and free of complications. Any additional features offered by the downloaders, like video editing tools or built-in converters, were also noted.

By putting these downloaders through this comprehensive evaluation, we were able to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and overall performance. This allows you to make an informed decision and choose the best YouTube downloader for your specific needs on Mac.

## Part 4\. How to Download YouTube Videos on Mac?

In addition to the previously mentioned YouTube downloader for Mac software, there are alternative methods available to obtain videos from YouTube, although they may not be as efficient as desktop software. As you have expressed interest, we will now provide you with a list of these methods.

### Method 1\. Download YouTube Videos on Mac with YouTube Premium

For a monthly fee of $11.99, YouTube Premium offers an ad-free and uninterrupted experience of both YouTube videos and YouTube music. Additionally, subscribers can enjoy the convenience of offline viewing and background playback. As of September 2021, YouTube Premium has introduced a new feature for its users - the ability to download YouTube videos directly from the browser on Mac and Windows 10\. This official method allows Premium users to instantly download any captivating or helpful videos they come across.

**Step 1.** Go to YouTube website, find and play the video you want to download. 

**Step 2.** At the right bottom corner of the playing window, there is a Download button available if the video is allowed to be downloaded by the publisher. Just hit the Download button.

**Step 3.** If you have joined the YouTube Premium plan, you can save the video in 720p or 480p directly. If didn’t have the membership, simply follow the on-screen guide to pay $11.99/month for offline contents from YouTube.

![YouTube Premium](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/youtube-premium.jpg) 

**Note:** Certainly, individuals who utilize YouTube for free are unable to download videos for offline viewing. Even YouTube Premium users face certain limitations. They are unable to save videos as files on their computers, and once their subscription expires, their access to the videos is revoked. Due to these reasons and for legitimate purposes, it becomes necessary to install alternative free YouTube downloaders for Mac.

### Method 2\. Download YouTube Videos on Mac with YouTube Downloader Software

We have introduced several YouTube downloaders for Mac for you, so you can choose any one of them to help you grab YouTube videos. 

Here, we take MacX YouTube Downloader as an example.

Step 1\. Free download MacX YouTube Downloader on Mac, install and launch it.

Step 3\. Paste the YouTube video URL you copied and tap "Analyze" to auto detect video info.

Step 4\. After parsing, choose format, resolution, and size.

**Is MacX YouTube downloader safe?**

It is compatible with all Mac devices, and it has been developed by a reputable and recognized company called Digiarty Software Inc. Rest assured, installing this software will not result in any additional installations such as malware or plugins.

### Method 3\. Download YouTube Videos on Mac with Online YouTube Downloader

Online YouTube downloaders offer a quick way to download videos on your Mac without installing any software. However, there are significant drawbacks to consider before using them:

* **Security risks:** These tools often come bundled with malware, adware, or viruses that can harm your computer.
* **Limited features:** Unlike desktop apps, online downloaders typically can't handle 4K videos, playlists, or videos with subtitles. You might also be limited in terms of available output formats and resolutions (often capped at 1080p). Batch downloading or playlist downloads are usually not supported either.
* **Slow speeds:** Download speeds can be sluggish due to reliance on remote servers and your internet connection.

Despite these drawbacks, online downloaders can be a convenient option if you need to download a single video occasionally. Here's a simplified process (although we recommend using the safer methods outlined earlier):

1. Copy the YouTube video URL.
2. Go to a website like ClipConverter.CC, freeyoutubedownloader.online, Ummy Online Video Downloader, BTCLOD.COM, SSYouTube, or SnapSave (We've tested these for functionality).
3. Paste the URL into the designated field on the website.
4. Choose your desired download format and resolution (if available).
5. Initiate the download.

### Method 4\. Download YouTube Videos on Mac through Screen Capture

There are lots of ways to [capture videos on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), and of course the built-in recorder is the best and most convenient one.

Step 1\. Press Command + Shift + 5 on Mac.

Step 2\. When the Record selected portion shows up, drag the crosshairs to select the video part you want to record. Also, click Options and make sure your microphone is selected.

Step 3\. Click Record.

Step 4\. Now start playing the video.

Step 5\. Wait for it to finish and then stop the video.

### In conclusion:

There are both pros and cons to all Mac YouTube downloaders. Each one offers a range of features, from basic to advanced. However, all of these YouTube video downloaders and methods mentioned above are capable of downloading YouTube videos on Mac. Therefore, you can confidently choose one to save YouTube videos for offline viewing. If necessary, you can utilize the advanced functionalities such as converting YouTube videos to MP3, downloading subtitles, and converting videos to other formats using a YouTube downloader like MacX Video Converter Pro.

By the way, there exist numerous alternative applications available for downloading YouTube videos on Mac. It is important to note that certain applications may have the potential to be malicious, hence it is advisable to utilize reliable security software for enhanced protection.

**Notice:** YouTube encourages users to stream their videos on the websites but not to download videos. So, you download YouTube videos on Mac at your own risk.
