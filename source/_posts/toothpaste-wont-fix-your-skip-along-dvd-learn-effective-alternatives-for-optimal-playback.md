## Part 1: What Causes DVD Scratched or Skipped

Before we offer the solutions to fix a DVD with skips, you need to know why your DVD skip or freeze or what cause a DVD to skip or freeze. It's taken for granted that the fingerprint, scratch and ash on DVD are to be blamed for the problem. And rubbing toothpaste along the scratch does somehow fix a skipping DVD to some degree, on condition that the source of skipping derives from the slight scratch of the DVD itself. Resources also indicate wiping in a straight line from the center of the disc to the outer rim, using banana, vaseline, peanut butter, or metal polish will help to make a DVD stop skipping and fix a scratched DVD. 

But the truth is these actions don't seem to make any improvement, cause there are some other reasons you may don't know when DVD keeps skipping but no scratches

###  Reason 1: DVD Player or Drive Problem 

The DVD player or DVD drive will contribute to the error as a result of dust accumulation, or weakened laser or servo after years of use. So simply dabbing a bit of toothpaste won't help to fix a skipping DVD or repair a DVD player that skips. All you have to do is to:  
1\. Clean your DVD player and DVD drive regularly.   
2\. Switch to another player to check whether the DVD stops skipping.

**Related:** [DVD player no sound](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), [DVD player not working](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)

###  Reason 2: DVD Format Issue 

NTSC and PAL are the two mainstream DVD formats. A DVD sold in a country (e.g. England) formatted in PAL will keep skipping or not possible play in a DVD player in NTSC format, with a message showing "Disc is incompatible". To fix a DVD that skips and freezes, you have to [convert Pal DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to NTSC format beforehand to make sure it is compatible with the DVD player. 

### Reason 3: Bad Burn or Copy of DVD 

Sometimes a DVD skips if the creation has encountered errors. So you have to re-copy or burn the DVD again and see if the DVD won't skip anymore. 

### Reason 4: Region Code

Different region codes will cause a DVD to skip or stop playing, digital rights management techniques designed to give film distributors full control over the content, release date and price according to the region. You can't [play a DVD in different regions](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)on your DVD player for over 5 times. To be specific, a DVD sold in America in region 1 may encounter skipping error or playback issue on a region 2 DVD player. How to fix a skipping DVD when it is encoded with other region codes?  
1\. Try the DVD in a multi-region DVD player or software DVD players like VLC, 5KPlayer that can defeat the regional lockout and then see whether the DVD still skips or not.   
2\. Make a copy of DVD with a third-party DVD ripper that can circumvent the region code of a DVD. Then you can watch DVD movie without error. 

### Reason 5: Copy Protections on Brand New DVDs

Many users notice that some newly bought DVD skips and even freezes the media player. Tech geeks put the DVD skipping problem down to the DVD copy protection scheme. For example, Sony's new ARccOS is culprit that leads to [bad sector](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) error and makes your DVD start skipping. To get back to normal playback, you have to rely on some DVD decrypter software to [Unlock protection from DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/).
